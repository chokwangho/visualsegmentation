		Analysts who visit malls each year said stores were relatively quiet Friday morning compared with previous years. In general, customer traffic has been slower throughout the holiday season, and with retailers offering unprecedented bargains in the weeks before Christmas, postholiday sales lost some allure.
		"These are the same discounts we've seen before the holiday," the chief industry analyst for NPD Group, Marshal Cohen, said. "Nothing new, nothing exciting."</p>
		<p>
		Mr. Cohen visited several Long Island malls Friday morning and said that there was a bit of a rush in the wee hours but that it subsided by 6 a.m. or so. He expected a lunchtime surge but said sales would not measure up to Black Friday, the blockbuster shopping day after Thanksgiving.
		Customer traffic was light Friday morning at malls owned or managed by Taubman Centers in Norfolk and Richmond, Va.; Clinton Township, Mich.; and Wellington, Fla.
		Mr. Cohen said that in the future, retailers should use popular brands and compelling products to lure customers, not just low prices.</p>
		<p>
		One retailer, at least, plans to do just that.
		Wal-Mart, which had a 3.4 percent sales increase in November and has been bucking grim retailing trends, said it would sell discounted iPhone 3Gs at nearly 2,500 stores beginning Sunday. A black 8-gigabyte iPhone is $197; the 16-gigabyte black or white model will go for $297, with a service agreement with AT&T. (Not to be outdone by other retailers, Wal-Mart said it would match the price of any local competitor's advertised store price within the same promotional period.)
		"Our electronics associates have been preparing for many weeks for the arrival of iPhone 3G," said Gary Severson, a senior vice president of entertainment at Wal-Mart.
		As expected, retailers had one of the worst holiday shopping seasons in decades, with sales falling by double digits in nearly all categories, including apparel, luxury goods, furniture and electronics and appliances, according SpendingPulse, a macroeconomic report by MasterCard Advisors that estimates retail sales (including by check and cash).</p>
		</p>
		<p>
		The report said that in November retail sales sank 5.5 percent compared with a year ago. They were down 8 percent in December, through Christmas Eve. Excluding gasoline, the decrease in holiday sales ranged from 2 to 4 percent.
		Snowstorms and chilly temperatures did nothing to inspire already hesitant consumers to go out and shop the last weekend before Christmas, usually one of the busiest periods of the year. The weather, though, may have contributed to some good news in online retailing, as consumers opted to surf the Web rather than brave the cold.
		Amazon on Friday reported its "best ever" holiday sales season, but the company did not provide sales figures so there was no telling whether its profits were eroded because of deep discounting. Amazon said that on its peak day, it shipped more than 5.6 million units. Investors sent shares up 0.45 percent, to $51.67, by Friday afternoon.</p>
